## Alerts

You can provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages by using following format to write a `blockquote`:

```md
> __Danger__: This is a very dangerous action!
```

With Docute it will be rendered as follows:

> __Danger__: This is a very dangerous action!

We also support other alert types which are:

```md
> __Info__: This is a info!

> __Warning__: This is a warning!

> __Success__: This is ok!

> __Note__: This is just a note!
```

And they look like:

> __Info__: This is a info!

> __Warning__: This is a warning!

> __Success__: This is ok!

> __Note__: This is just a note!
