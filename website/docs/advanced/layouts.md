## Docs Layout

The most basic layout in Docute is `docs`, it renders the <router-link to="/docs/essentials/the-docute-instance#docs-and-nav">docs</router-link> menu on left sidebar, just like what you see on this page.


## Page Layout

For pages like About page, you may use the `page` layout to replace <router-link to="/docs/essentials/the-docute-instance#docs-and-nav">docs</router-link> with a __Table of Contents__ menu on the left sidebar.

## Homepage Layout

The `homepage` layout only cares about the front-matter part within your markdown file, it's used to render root `/` path.
